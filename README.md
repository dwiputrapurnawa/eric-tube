# HOW TO RUN

Firstly you have to install node modules in client and server directory separately

Server Node modules Install :
- cd me-tube
- npm install

Next,install in client also:
- cd client/
- npm install

if you got error about bcrypt during install node modules, you have to install bcrypt module in server
- npm install --save bcrypt
- npm install

then dont forget to install ffmpeg in your operating system
- if you using windows , you can download in here https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html#build-windows

- but if you using linux, you can download in here https://tracker.debian.org/pkg/ffmpeg

Then you go back to previous directory in server 
- cd ..

finally you can run the web app
- npm run dev


# Note 
Before you run the server you have to create a new file javascript named 'dev.js' to run 'npm run dev'
so go to directory server/config, and create 'dev.js' file in that directory.

copy this code to 'dev.js'

module.exports = {
      mongoURI:"yourDatabaseConnection"
}

and dont forget to create a mongoDB database to connect to the application
